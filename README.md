# Reuse
Please contact benjamin.blonder@berkeley.edu if you are interested in using these data. The archive is primarily provided for version tracking. Re-use is possible but requires additional knowledge about data quality control and field decisions that may not be clear from the available files and documentation. We are planning to use these data for a range of integral projection and individual based modeling projects and ask that you respect our goals and our student's PhD dissertation aims.

# Funding
Data were supported by the UK Natural Environment Research Council, the Research Council of Norway, Arizona State University, the University of California Berkeley, the Peder Saether Center for Advanced Study, and the Rocky Mountain Biological Laboratory (Navjot Sodhi fellowship and other sources).
