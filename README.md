# Data from the Mt. Baldy community demography study
## Principal investigator: Benjamin Blonder (UC Berkeley)
## Collaborators: Courtenay Ray, Rozália Kapás, Roberto Salguero Gómez
## Funding: United States National Science Foundation, DEB-2425575; Norwegian Research Council, KLIMAFORSK #250233, 223257; United Kingdom Natural Environment Research Council, NE/M019160; Rocky Mountain Biological Laboratory (Navjot Sodhi fellowship, Johnson Family endowment, and other sources); Peder Saether Center for Advanced Study.

# How to use
Census data (in `census/`) are updated on an annual basis in subfolders (e.g., `2023`, `2024`). If you are conducting time series analyses, you should use the data in the newest-year subfolder only. Prior years are provided for historical reference. Current-year `.xlsx` files may have been manually edited relative to prior year datasets to fix known errors or introduce additional functionality.

The most analysis-ready files are found in the `outputs` subfolder for each year. Multi-year data for population modeling can be found in `demography_2014-XXXX.csv`; per-year data for spatial modeling can be found in `census XXXX clean only field tags.csv`; per-year data for community analyses can be found in `abundances XXXX clean only field tags.csv` where `XXXX` refers to year.

# Data use and collaboration
Please contact benjamin.blonder@berkeley.edu if you are interested in using these data. Re-use is possible but will require additional knowledge about data quality control and field decisions that may not be clear from the available files and documentation. We are planning to use these data for a range of integral projection and individual based modeling projects and ask that you get in touch first to discuss your goals. You do not need to collaborate with us to use these data but we request you let us know about your project.
