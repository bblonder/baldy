Original note for tag 2178: this plant is equals 1670 LUPARG,got a new tag because the old one was missing. 2020 update. Can see in the 2016 photo that it is a PHAHAS and a large individual...~10cm. Removed merge with 1670 since that plant is in plot 41 not 20. Can see in the 2016 plot photo that it has an old tag (square scratch), so it was censused previously, but the round silver tag wasn't brought with the rest in 2016.... Plant appears in the 2015 photo with a tag by it and in 2015 it is a small indiviual ~2 cm. Plant and tag do not appear in 2014 photo, so was a new plant in 2015. Plant is not 1617 (which sounds similar to 1670), since that tag is visible in another location in the 2016 photo. I think the tag is 1620 since 1620 could look similar to 1670 when scratched on a tag. 1620's silver tag was likely not brought up with the rest in 2015 because its data was missing in 2015. In 2016, 1620 is supposed to be a 12 cm CHADOU in flower at X=100, Y=40, but there is no visible CHADOU like that in the 2015 or 2016 photo (can see other smaller CHADOUs that have tags by them in the photos....). The plant tagged as 2178 is one of the only flowering plants in the area. 1620 tag and plant are missing in 2017. Changed coords from x=100, y=40 to reflect the measured position of 2178 (x=173, y=52). Tag 1620 was missing in the 2018 tag pull."
